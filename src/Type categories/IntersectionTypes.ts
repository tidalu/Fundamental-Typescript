// intersection types in typescript 


// intersection types in Typescript can be described using the &(ampersand) operator.

// for example what if we had a Promise, that had extra starTime and endTime properties added to it?

function makeWeek():Date & { end: Date}{
    // â¬… return type

    const start = new Date()
    const end = new Date(start.valueOf())// + ONE_WEEK)  // one week is actually should be added

    return {...start, end} // kind of object assign
    

}

const thisWeek = makeWeek()

thisWeek.toISOString()

thisWeek.end.toISOString()
